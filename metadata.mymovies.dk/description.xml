  <description lang="en">Download Movie information from www.mymovies.dk. My Movies is the single largest source movie disc meta data (DVD, Blu-ray and HD-DVD) but also has the best library of movie posters and fanart. My Movies is also the fastest source of meta data for XBMC meaning library updates are as fast as possible (9+ times faster). As something unique you can use barcodes in addition to foldernames and IMDb url's to get perfect matches of your backups. All these features comes with a price as My Movies is not free - you can either contribute data to get points, you can donate money to get points or you can buy API access. Either way you need 2500 points and a login to use this scraper. More info can be found at the website...</description>
